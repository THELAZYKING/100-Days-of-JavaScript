 This is my 100 days JavaScript Code Challenge to become a legit Web Developer (having daily 1 Mini project). This Challenge will be supplied with Sufficient Resources and will suggest a daily Problem statement (and Starter Files at later parts). Basically its my way of revising the technologies.


## Why use It
1. *Beginner Developers* | `Those who don't know Web Development but are comfortable with working with Computer` | Full Stack Development Jobs are ranked No. 2 in World [Source: Udacity] and what better than building projects along with learning new Technologies.

2. *Intermediate Developers* | `I associate this level with those who know these technology but don't know it in depth`| This is a Fun Revision as well as a good Practice along with doing projects.

3. *Advanced Developers* | `Comfortable with these technology `| Kindly help the Community with Tips and how to improve this repository . I would love to improve this challenge with your Valuable Challenge.


## About Video Resources
Most of the the Videos are from YouTube and articles from Medium and Mozilla Documentation. 

*I'd appreciate your help to add free and always-available public sources, such as YouTube videos to accompany the online course videos.*

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.  Each day I take one Topic, watch videos about that subject, and code the Implementation.
There will be Video of 1 - 1.5 Hours EveryDay and a project that wont take more than 2 Hours if `Done Right`
